# hashicorp

Get Started:

Replace info in variables.auto.pkrvars.hcl.example with your specific info.
Rename variables.auto.pkrvars.hcl.example to variables.auto.pkrvars.hcl

Configure autounattend.xml located in /setup/2019 to meet your needs.

Run ./build-2019.ps1.

From start to finish this took me about an hour to complete, but will vary based on hardware, network speed, etc.
